# 🔹 Milestone 1 — Data Preparation & Project Foundation

## Objective

The first milestone established the foundation for the **Healthcare Operations Intelligence Dashboard** by organizing the healthcare data required for analysis.

## Work Completed

- Identified the main healthcare entities required for the project.
- Prepared the project data for analysis.
- Worked with patient, admission, treatment, staff, bed and facility information.
- Performed data preparation and integration required for Power BI.
- Established the department and date dimensions required for analysis.
- Planned the KPIs and operational questions to be addressed through the dashboard.
- Used Git/GitHub for collaborative project development.

## Data Entities Established

The final Power BI model contains:

- `Dim_Patient`
- `Dim_Department`
- `Dim_Facility`
- `Dim_Date`
- `Fact_Admissions`
- `Fact_Treatments`
- `Fact_Beds`
- `Fact_Staff`

A dedicated `_Measures` table contains the analytical measures used in the report.

## Milestone 1 Outcome

The project moved from separate healthcare information sources toward a structured Power BI data model that could support patient, admission, treatment, workforce, facility and capacity analysis.

---

# 🔹 Milestone 2 — Patient Flow & Service Demand Intelligence

## Objective

Milestone 2 focused on understanding **patient flow, admissions, treatment demand and department-level workload**.

## Analysis Performed

### Patient Flow

- Patient activity was analyzed using `Dim_Patient`.

- Date

## Insights & Recommendations

The final milestone converts the dashboard analysis into management-oriented observations.

The final dashboard includes measures and analytical areas covering:

- Bed utilization
- Length of stay
- Workforce performance
- Treatment completion
- Capacity
- Patient flow
- Workforce deployment
- Treatment status
- Geographic demand

## Final Dashboard Insights

The final Power BI analysis reports:

- **63.9% bed occupancy**
- **7.58 days average length of stay**
- **84.34% staff efficiency**
- **75.1% treatment completion**
- **Neurology** as the highest workload department in the operational analysis
- **Orthopedics** as the lowest workload department in the operational analysis
- **Consultation** as the highest-volume treatment type
- **Neurology** treatment completion rate of **78.35%**
- **Dermatology** treatment completion rate of **68.85%**
- **Dermatology** pending treatment rate of **24.59%**

These values are included because they are part of the project dashboard analysis already documented from the Power BI solution.

## Recommendations

Based on the final dashboard analysis:

### Capacity
Monitor bed utilization and available capacity against demand.

### Patient Flow
Monitor admissions, discharges and length of stay to identify areas requiring attention.

### Workforce
Use assigned shifts, worked shifts and staff efficiency to support workforce planning.

### Treatment
Monitor pending and cancelled treatments by department and treatment type.

### Geographic Performance
Compare patient activity and facility capacity across cities.

## Milestone 4 Outcome

Milestone 4 completed the geographic analysis and added the final insights and recommendations layer, resulting in the completed Power BI decision-support dashboard.

# 🔐 Data Authenticity & Integrity

This documentation is intended to represent the **final Power BI project as implemented**.

### Data handling principles

- The original dataset should remain unchanged.
- No artificial records are added to the source data.
- No dashboard values are manually fabricated for documentation.
- Dashboard metrics should be taken from the Power BI model/visuals.
- Table names and fields in this README correspond to the final Power BI model shown in the project.
- Any future transformation should be stored separately from the original source.

---

# 🏁 Final Outcome

The **Healthcare Operations Intelligence Dashboard** provides an integrated Power BI environment for analyzing:

- Patients
- Admissions
- Treatments
- Staff
- Beds
- Facilities
- Departments
- Dates
- Cities
- Operational KPIs

The final model combines fact tables, dimension tables and a dedicated measures table to support interactive healthcare operations analysis.
